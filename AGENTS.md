- Certificates: one row per user in certificates (random code), issued only via issueCertificate after a server-side completion check; /verificar/$code is public and returns only printed fields — keeps certificates verifiable without exposing other data.
- Studio is an isolated external app (Next.js on Vercel, basePath "/studio"): the /studio root and splat server routes proxy to the fixed origin https://jaikuua-studio-app.vercel.app keeping the /studio prefix; jaikuaa.com is hosted by Lovable, so vercel.json rewrites do not apply here. Never import Next.js into Jaikuaa, never proxy other root paths, never inject admin secrets (see docs/studio-proxy.md).
